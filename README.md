# cyclistic-case-study

This is a case study for the Google's Data Analytics Certificate capestone project. 

## Scenario

I am a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company based in chicago. The director of marketing believes that the company's future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, my team wants to undestand how casual riders and annual members use Cylcistic bikes differently.

The company had 3 customer plans:
- Single-ride passes
- Full-day passes
- Annual memberships
  - Customers who purchase *single-ride passes* or *Full-day passes* are referred to as casual riders.
  - Customers who purchase *annual memberships* are referred to as Cyclistic members.
 

  In this project I used R, Google Sheets, and Google Slides. The data was too large for Google Sheets so I decided to use a sample dataset, with a 98% confidence level and 2% margin of error. Sample sizes are choosen through googles Sample Size Calculator shared in the course.
